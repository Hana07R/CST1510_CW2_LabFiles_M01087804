**Course:** CST1510 – CW2 – Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

## Project Description

A Streamlit-based platform implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The system allows users to manage Cyber Incidents, IT Tickets, Security Threats, and interact with an AI Assistant.
This project demonstrates modular design, role-based access, and secure handling of sensitive data.

## Features
**Cyber Incidents:** Add, update, and view incidents using OOP classes
**IT Tickets:** Track and manage tickets with object-based ticket management
**Security Threats:** Analyze threats via dedicated classes
**AI Assistant:** Ask questions and get intelligence reports using AI
**User Management:** Role-based access for Admin and Analyst using OOP User classes
**Secure Data Handling:** Sensitive files (databases and secrets) are ignored from GitHub

## Technical Implementation
- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Streamlit for interactive web interface

## OOP Concepts Used:
- Classes and objects for Users, Tickets, Security Incidents, AI Assistant
- Methods for CRUD operations
- Modular design with models and services
- **Database:** SQLite (.db files created locally, ignored from GitHub)
- **Data Storage:** CSV files for sample data
- **Validation:** Role-based access and data validation
